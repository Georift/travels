It poured with rain overnight, so we woke to a pool outside our door. After a quick breakfast we were off to Depot Hill for a recommended walk to see amazing wildflowers.  At the Hill just outside of town, Paul and I headed up while PoPPPP waited in the carpark. When we got to the top, there was a sign pointing out the directions of each of the local attractions. It was then obvious we were at the wrong(ly) \[inside family joke!] Depot Hill lookout. So we quickly scampered back down the hill, as we needed to get to the correct location and be back in time to vacate the caravan park by 10.00am (not wanting to incur the ire of the Caravan Manageress!).

It started to drizzle as we got to the real Depot Hill, so Paul and I set off.  We didn’t venture too far before we realised that time was against us and we headed back. In the short distance we did manage there were still only a scant few wildflowers.

As we left the caravan park, I spied a couple of Galahs. I wondered why them didn’t fly away as I approached, but was gratefully I was getting a photo.  As I ventured closer, they squawked their displeasure. It was then that I realised that they were nesting, so I left them in peace.

We headed to our final destination of Geraldton, via Greenough so I could take a photo of a leaning tree.  I was hoping to take a drone photo, but the wind was howling, so no joy there.  The sign read:

“The Leaning Trees of Greenough belong to a native Western Australian species Eucalyptus camaldulensis, River Gum.  Their characteristic lean is caused by constant strong southerly winds that burn off growth on the windward side (flagging).”

Randolph Stow, immortalised the Greenough Leaning Trees in his book, “The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea”

**“On the windswept flats, crippled gumtrees washed their hair.”**

PoPPPP’s next request from his memory bank was to have pies for lunch from the Dongara Bakery.  They claim to have arguably the best pies in Australia.  I say arguably, as it seems every pie/bakery in Australia claims this title. So, we stopped. We sampled. And our verdict? …. OK but not the best! That title goes to the service station at Dandaragan. Though they claimed their pies were famous with a price tag to match, but worth every penny.

We set up at our overnight Caravan Park (BIG 4 Sunset Holiday Park) before heading out for some sightseeing.  First stop the Horizon (glass ball on the Beresford Foreshore). The 1.5m sphere was first featured at Cottesloe’s 2019 Sculpture by the Sea exhibition. It is filled with 1800 litres of water inside.  The light reflections invert its surrounds.  The perfect combination of art and physics.

It was then onto the HMAS Sydney II Memorial. This memorial is a moving tribute to the sailors who lost their lives off the Western Australian coastline during a battle with the German ship HSK Kormoran on the 19th November, 1941. Steeped in symbolism, it is a moving and thoughtful memorial to the 645 men lost in one of the darkest days in Australian naval history. Since we were here in 2009, the Pool of Remembrance has been installed. On the 16th March 2008 the wreck of HMAS Sydney II was found. The floor of the pool forms a map, showing the location of HMAS Sydney II. The wingtip of the gull is the exact spot where the Sydney lies.

Our final stop for the day was the Museum of Geraldton.  As we got to the entrance PoPPPP and I were pleased to discover that the current temporary exhibition was the National Geographic Photo of the Year entries, and wow there were some amazing captures.

Day 2 ended with dinner being cooked in Dad’s cabin, making the most of the $139 per night price tag!  So, to date on this adventure, Ziggy (our cooker) has yet to pull his weight!
