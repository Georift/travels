We arrived at Enid and BR’s place for morning tea. It was a lovely catch up.  When Dad arranged the meeting BR comment that he couldn’t wait to see the new caravan.  PoPPPP was most put out that BR was more interested in seeing the van than his old friend!
We then set off for Kalbarri, though Paul and PoPPPP did allow a stop for me to take a couple of photos of the painted sheep in Northam. The town is dotted with brightly painted fibre-glass sheep and sheep dogs. The sheep are a result of a town festival held in 2018 called “Ewe Turn”. I love these quirky things you see in country towns.

We took the longer route to Kalbarri via Hutt Lagoon, or the Pink Lake.  Unfortunately, we were still having intermittent showers, so the skies were overcast and gloomy.  Apparently the best time to see the pink colour is between 10am and 2pm, but on a clear sunny sky.  Our sky was completely the opposite and we had to view it between the showers, so our visibility was poor. Hopefully over the next few days we can come back when the weather is better.

We arrived at our stay for the next 3 nights, the Kalbarri Anchorage Caravan Park. We arrived early enough that we decided to head out to the Skywalk. And WOW! I’ve seen pictures, but seeing it first hand was so much better.  It is a stunning look out and an engineering marvel.

As a nod to the Aboriginal culture, visitors are greeted with an entry sign stating “Kaju Yatka”. These are the Nanda words for ‘sky’ and ‘to walk’. There are two skywalks where you can literally walk 100m over the Kalbarri National Park. One projection 25 metres beyond the rim of the Murchison Gorge, the other is 17m. Look out around the Skywalk as you wander around, as there are bronze sculptures scatter, some in most unexpected places. At an investment of $24 million the project opened on 12th June 2020 and really is a world class tourist attraction. Well done Kalbarri.

Paul and I then wandered down to Nature’s Window which is an iconic wind-eroded “window” in layered sandstone which frames the river and has stunning gorge views. A perfect spot for a photo and we ticked that box.

We headed back to town to try for a sunset photo at the channel entrance - but the weather continued to hinder our plans.  It really was amazing that we managed to squeeze so much in between the showers.  Here’s hoping for better weather tomorrow.

We finished the evening with dinner at Finlay’s. This unique outdoor restaurant and microbrewery with dirt floors was probably not the ideal location for an evening meal when it’s raining.  But hey, we didn’t let it stop us all day, why stop now and the staff were amazing in squeezing us in under some cover, by a roaring fire.

Kalbarri is opening up again after the devastation of cyclone Seroja which hit the town on the 11th April this year, with over 70% of the homes and businesses suffering damage. But like most country town they had not lost their spirit or their humour. Findlay’s newest beer was named Seroja and was described as packing a punch!  When I went to the Visitor’s Centre to check on Dad’s bus booking the lady advise that he could wait at the bus shelter by the Hotel.  “Wait, is the bus shelter still there?” she asked the other lady. You got to love their spirit. They have picked themselves up, dusted themselves off and back in business.
