After months of planning and weeks of final arrangements it was time to hit the road for Wendera’s Land Lap.  We are swapping the waves for bitumen and dirt, as the skipper and crew of Wendera now traverse our great Australian landscape.

We had a final family dinner last night at 49.  PoPPPP joined us for the first leg of the trip, up to Kalbarri, so we were all up early, raring to go.  It was drizzling with rain when we left Perth just before 8.30am.  The upside of this though, was a rainbow out the window as we finally departed the city.  That’s a good sign …. right? We had a bathroom stop at Gillingarra, which rates a mention as the ladies’ toilet had a quaint old sink that matched the bathroom tiles!

For lunch we pulled up at a rest stop under the trees at a rest area in Carnamah.  As soon as I opened Tessa’s door a flock of pink and grey galahs swooped down and roosted in the tree directly above us, all of them looking down expectantly and in anticipation of lunch!  Nope! No today! No poop on our beautiful new van. We quickly moved to a galah free location.

We had a photo stop at Three Springs, as this was where Luna (Elizabeth and Lewis’s dog) was from. We just had to send her a photo.  The town had some old wheat silos that were crying out for some silo art, however the buildings in front had some lovely artwork.

The drive was very picturesque and we were amazed by the volume of water lying by the side of the road. There seemed to be lakes and streams everywhere, evidence of how wet this winter has been.  This meant the canola crops were looking very healthy and there were literally fields of gold everywhere.

We arrived at the Mingenew Caravan Park, quickly unhitched and headed off to Coalseam Conservation Park with a plan to see some wildflowers.

The day was still overcast, with pockets of rain, but as we were only here for the night, this was our only chance to sightsee.

At the lookout we were nearly blown away with the strength of the wind.  Paul had to steady PoPPPP in place for the photos.  Unfortunately, we were a little early for the carpets of wildflower displays.  We made do with the little pockets of colour we saw and also took some photos of the setting sun over a canola field.

PoPPPP had recounted the story of his footy days and heading to the Mingenew Pub after the game for a session, with Paul asleep in the car out the front.  So we just had to head back to the old stomping ground, to whet the whistle and have some dinner.
