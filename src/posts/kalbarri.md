* Day 4
* Kalbarri

A new day but yet another overcast and raining one. Undeterred we decided to venture out and see the sights.

The first stop was the entrance into the Murchison River. We bypassed this in Wendera in 2009, as it was gnarly and something you would not want to attempt without local knowledge.  As we were watching one of the channel markers was going under the waves.  Not the best thing for a navigational aid!  There was a memorial to commemorate the wreck of the Zuytdorp on the coast north of Kalbarri in June 1712, after which the Zuytdorp Cliff get their name.  The Zuytdorp is one of three Dutch East Indian Company Ships that were known to have been shipwrecked off the mid-west coast.  We learnt of their fascinating history at the Geraldton Museum.

We then headed to look at the Kalbarri coastline, starting at the Natural Bridge and Island Rock.  By this time, the rain had stopped but the wind was blowing a gale.  So much so we had a complimentary exfoliation from the sand blasting in our faces.  The sun peeked out as we arrived at Island Rock.

The wind, waves and salt spray from the Indian Ocean help carve a remarkable coastal landform.  The steep cliffs of layered rocks that rise from the sea are made of 480-million-year-old Tumblagood Sandstone.  Wave action erodes the softer layers of rock to form notches that ultimately undermine the cliffs, leading to their collapse. With time, sea caves enlarge and form an arch, this is how the Natural Bridge was formed.  Eventually, with further erosion, the arch collapse leaving a sea stack like Island Rock.  It is amazing to see the forces of Mother Nature at work.

The next stop was Shellhouse Grandstand before heading to Eagle Gorge. We were going to by-pass Pot Alley, as there was no wheelchair access and PoPPPP’s legs were crying out that he had done enough walking. But PoPPPP said he was happy to wait in Tyrion taking photos, while Paul and I had a look.  And I’m so glad we did.  As we scrambled down the ravine, Paul commented how much it looked some of the Karijini Gorges. However, it differed when it opened out onto a secluded beach.  I saw some very strange blue things that had washed up onto the sand.  Could they be some sort of hatched shark egg?  I don’t know, but they were very pretty!

The final trail was Red Bluff and even though it was wheel chair friendly, one look at the incline and PoPPPP left it to Paul and I to climb.  Good call PoPPPP, the wind was blowing straight in our faces making the ascent to the summit much harder than it needed to be. You were rewarded with views over the town of Kalbarri.

We went home for a well-deserved lunch break.

After lunch with improved weather conditions, we headed to the Z Bend Lookout.  The Lookout is above the gorge in the middle part of the “Z Bend” a distinctive zig-zag section of the Murchison River. The unusual shape is formed by fractures within the red Tumblagooda Sandstone.  The Lookout provided truly amazing views. Unfortunately, the Z Bend trail was closed due to damage from cyclone Seroja.

The street we turn down from the main drag to get to our caravan park is called Clotsworthy, which we remarked was an unusual name. Testing our brains, we started compiling other ‘worthy’ names ….
