* Day 5
* Location: Kalbarri, 592kms north of Perth

I see a pattern here …. we woke to another miserable day. PoPPPP’s legs were telling him that he did too much walking yesterday, so he opted to stay home. Paul and I, seeing a break in the weather with patches of blue sky, decided to head to the Pink Lake in the hope of seeing it in a better light.  All the way there the weather tantalised us - first with some sunny bright blue skies which quickly reverted to the seemingly standard overcast and grey clouds.  This may be a wasted trip. But I was determined and Paul made it happen, finding the perfect spot to send Maverick (the drone) up.  The sun was peeking out, enough for there to be some pink colour. Let’s say it was a cloudy pink as opposed to its famous bubble-gum pink.  But hey, this was better than nothing.

We headed back for a late lunch and settled in for a relaxing afternoon, as the weather turned really ugly. Lucky the Olympics was on TV, so that was pretty much our afternoon activity.

We headed to the Kalbarri Pub for dinner.  It was absolutely teeming, so we decided on having a quick round of drinks, ordering a pizza to takeaway and headed home.
